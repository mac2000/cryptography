[Public Key Cryptography - Computerphile](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSIDS_lvRv4)

The problem with symetric algorithms is that the secret is shared between everyone

Asymmetric algorithms has private and public keys instead

The most common examples are: SSH and HTTPS

At moment there is only RSA example which seems to be most popular one
